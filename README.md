# ecoride_code_showcase
Some code from a team project called EcoRide (https://zortex5.pythonanywhere.com/). A rideshare app intended to facilitate eco-friendly commutes. You can only see rides in your chosen city, so feel free to create multiple accounts in the same city to see other drives in the dashboard. There are some prepopulated drives in Seattle.
